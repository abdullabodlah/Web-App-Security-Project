## 🛠️ Key Security Measures Implemented

| Component        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Input Validation | All user inputs sanitized using `validator` package                       |
| 🔐 Password Security | Passwords hashed securely using `bcrypt`                                 |
| 🧠 Session Handling  | Session created only after successful login                              |
| 📝 Logging System   | Custom logging using `fs` and `path`; records both success and failure   |
| 🧪 Manual Testing   | Verified login/registration workflows with valid/invalid data             |

## 🧪 Manual Test Results

| Action                                | Result                                      |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Login with valid credentials          | Session created, redirected to home         |
| Login with invalid credentials        | Access denied, log entry created            |
| Register with valid data              | Data stored, log entry created              |
| Attempt invalid input (XSS, script)   | Input rejected during validation            |

## 📁 Modified/Created Files

| File                   | Purpose                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `router.js`            | Core logic: login, registration, session, logging      |
| `logs/logger.js`       | Custom logger module using `fs`                        |
| `logs/auth.log`        | Authentication logs storage file                       |
| `views/*.ejs`          | Updated login/register forms with validation feedback  |
