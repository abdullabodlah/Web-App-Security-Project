# Week 3 – Advanced Security Implementation

## 📌 Overview

This week focused on advanced security hardening and monitoring. Key efforts included verifying secure service configurations, implementing centralized logging, and confirming a reduced attack surface post-fixes from Week 1 and 2.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

- Verified service isolation and port exposure using `nmap`
- Enabled MongoDB authentication and restricted access to localhost
- Ensured Node.js service is firewalled and free of known vulnerabilities
- Implemented security logging using `winston`
  - Captures failed login attempts, suspicious requests, and service events
- Assessed system posture to confirm minimized exposure

---

## 🔐 Key Security Achievements

- MongoDB access restricted and secured
- Node.js service verified clean
- Logging operational and filtering critical events
- No critical issues detected via scan

---

## 🛠 Tools & Tech Used

- `nmap` for network scanning
- `winston` for structured security logs
- Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (existing stack)
